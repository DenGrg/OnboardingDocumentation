# Creative Automation - General overview

Celtra creative avtomation tool enables users to scale their creative production by combining templates and content stored in feeds to output different combination of products, formats, sizes, layouts and content. Now lets see what this means and how you can achieve it.

The example below shows a traditinal way that Celtra has been used to build creatives.

* Chose a Channel, this defines where and how your creative will be shown:
  + Facebook
  + Twitter
  + Snapchat
  + ...
* Chose a format, each of the channels has a set of predefined supported creative formats e.g.:
  + Facebook
    - Image
    - Video
    - Carousel
* Then you need to select a size of your ad, this depend on where the add will be shown e.g.:
  + 320x150
  + 1024x768
  + ...
* Now you need to define the layout:
  + Where will you place your images and/or videos?
  + Where will the text be?
  + Are there gonna be any animations?
  + Where will you place the button that will take you to the homepage of the advertiser.

all of the above settings define everything about your creative. 

## What is a creative?

In technical terms a creative is defined by certain parameters (channel, format, size, layout) and content (image, video, text, url...).
The parameters are grouped together in a template, content is then linked to the template and the output is a creative.

So far everything is amazing. So what is the problem that we are solving?

In reality advertising campaigns require incredible amount of creatives. Lets use an example to have a better visual representation.

#### Example

Lets say a chlothing chain is comming out with a new collection for Summer 2021 and they want to acompany it with an advertising campaign. You are in charge of creative production for the entire online part of the advertising campaign.

**Here are their requirements:**
* The company are launching 6 new products and you are required to feature each of them in creative.
* The campaign should be present on the following channels: YouTube (2 formats), Facebook (2 formats) & Twitter (6 formats).
* The campaign needs to be translated to 10 different markets. 

Lets just calculate how manny different creatives are needed:

Each format needs atleast 6 different creatives, one for each product. Then you need to multiply this by 10 for each of the different languages. 

```
  products = 6
  YouTube = 2
  Facebook = 2
  Twitter = 6
  languages = 10
  
  (products * youTube) * languages + (products * Facebook) * languages + (products * Twitter) * languages = 600
```

When you start adding even more languages, products and formats, you can see that the end number is growing exponentialy.
But what if you could only build 10 creatives instead of the original 600?
